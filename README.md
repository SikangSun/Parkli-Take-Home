Application overview: Coffee is an imaginary application that lets user read books and documents on their phone. Users can download from online libraries or import locally, read, and save their progress automatically.

App navigation flow: 
Frame1 click "Sign In" button to go to frame2
Frame2 click "You" in the bottom right to go to frame3

Design Decisions:
Brown is chosen to be the main color theme to reflect the title and instill a mellow atmosphere in accordance to reading. 
The first three navigation buttons (home, popular, shelf) are meant to be book sorting options, that is: home will bring up all online and local entries, popular will sorted the current trending books, and shelf will show bookmarked entries.
