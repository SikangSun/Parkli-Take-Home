Starting Instruction: Inside of the coffee folder, run in XCode and start preview

Application overview: Coffee is an imaginary application that lets user read books and documents on their phone. Users can download from online libraries or import locally, read, and save their progress automatically.

App navigation flow: 
Frame1: click "Sign In" button to go to frame2
Frame2: click "You" in the bottom right to go to frame3

Design Decisions:
Brown is chosen to be the main color theme to reflect the title and instill a mellow atmosphere in accordance to reading. 
The first three navigation buttons (home, popular, shelf) are meant to be book sorting options, that is: home will bring up all online and local entries, popular will sort the current trending books, and shelf will show bookmarked entries.


Comment:
The project took me about 10 hours, and despite that, I only finished around half of the features that I had planned. This is mainly due to my ignorance of app development (which I learned for this project), swiftUI, the Apple ecosystem, and even Figma (for 2 hours, I was researching how to export Figma design to SwiftUI to no notable results). \
Here is a list of the things that I wanted to implement:\
Better navigation (right now navigations do not work as intended, that is, back button should not exist on frame2 and navigation bar should not move between frame 2 and frame 3)\
Wave animation on sign in screen (there are some code at the end of ooffee.swift that started on this)\
Scroll view on books\
Better default book components, with covers, titles, and progress bar implemented (according to Figma design)\
Sorting for popular and bookmarked

Comment2:
For the project, because I do not have Apple hardware, I had to set up a remote desktop with my friend's MacBook, which had delayed inputs (~0.5s) and terrible quality (about 360p). This was very tiring to use, all while trying to learn a new language, framework, and paradigm of development. The project was nowhere near as polished as I usually have for any web applications (which is what I am used to), despite the over-commitment of hours. In the end, I threw in the towel when I was physically burned out from looking at the highly pixelated remote-sharing screen. I tried my best given the constraint, and perhaps that was the best I could have done.
